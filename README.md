You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## OMNIA: The Sovereign AI Operating System

**Sovereignty is the ultimate utility.**

OMNIA is a next-generation AI orchestration platform designed for the 2026 intelligence landscape. It is not just an interface; it is a command center for human agency.

## 🌌 The Core Vision
Artificial Intelligence should not be a walled garden. OMNIA provides a unified, cross-platform architecture that allows users to seamlessly switch between:
- **Local Compute**: Run OS models directly on your own hardware for maximum privacy.
- **Sovereign Cloud**: Access distributed, high-performance GPU clusters.
- **API Orchestration**: Bring your own keys (BYOK) for proprietary models (Gemini, Grok, GPT).

## ⚡ Key Modalities
- **Reasoning**: Advanced LLM orchestration for deep research and logic.
- **Creativity**: High-fidelity Image, Audio, and Video generation.
- **Autonomy**: Edge-capable agents designed for real-world tasks.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS 4.0
- **State**: Zustand-powered reactive orchestration.
- **Deployment**: Engineered for Vercel Edge Runtime.

## 🚀 Deployment Status
Deployed to [omnia.vercel.app](https://omnia.vercel.app). 
101% Perfected. Zero Bloat. Maximum Speed.
